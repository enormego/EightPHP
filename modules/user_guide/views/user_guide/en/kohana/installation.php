Kohana is installed in four easy steps:

 1. <?php echo html::anchor('user_guide/kohana/downloads', 'Download') ?> a copy of Kohana.
 2. Unzip the package you downloaded. This should create a <tt>kohana</tt> directory.
 3. Upload the Kohana files to your webserver, placing <file>index</file> in the directory that you would like Kohana accessible from.
 4. Edit the <?php echo html::anchor('user_guide/general/configuration', 'global configuration') ?> file <file>application/config/config</file>
 5. Test your installation by opening the URL you set as the <config>base_url</config> in your favorite browser

If you see the Welcome page of the user guide, your Kohana installation is complete! If you are new to Kohana, start by reading the <?php echo html::anchor('user_guide/kohana/starting', 'Getting Start') ?> page.
